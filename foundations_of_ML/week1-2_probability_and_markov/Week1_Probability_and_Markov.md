### Probability Foundations & Markov Assumption

#### Introduction
Probability theory provides the core mathematical language for reasoning under uncertainty, while the Markov assumption simplifies sequential dependencies—both are fundamental for modern NLP and language modeling.

Through this module you will refresh key probability concepts and see how the Markov assumption enables tractable modeling of text sequences.
