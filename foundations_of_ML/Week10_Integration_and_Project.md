### Integration & Mini-Project

#### Introduction
The capstone week integrates probabilistic and neural methods. You will build a hybrid language predictor that combines an n-gram baseline with a small neural network, reinforcing all concepts learned so far.

#### Knowledge Points
- [[Designing a hybrid n-gram + neural model]]
- [[Predicting the next word with combined methods]]
- [[Review of all learned concepts]]
- [[Transition plan to transformer architectures]]
