#### Introduction
Linear algebra is the backbone of all modern machine-learning frameworks. Vectors and matrices represent data and parameters, while operations such as matrix multiplication power everything from linear regression to transformers.

#### Knowledge Points
- Vectors & vector operations
- Matrices & matrix multiplication
- Dot product, norms, and projections
- Eigenvalues & eigenvectors
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Practical coding exercises with NumPy/PyTorch
