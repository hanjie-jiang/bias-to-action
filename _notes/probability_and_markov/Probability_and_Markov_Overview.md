### Probability Foundations & Markov Assumption

#### Introduction
Probability theory provides the core mathematical language for reasoning under uncertainty, while the Markov assumption simplifies sequential dependenciesâ€”both are fundamental for modern NLP and language modeling.

Through this module you will refresh key probability concepts and see how the Markov assumption enables tractable modeling of text sequences.
